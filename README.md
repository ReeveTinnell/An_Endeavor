# An_Endeavor
Learning to get Endeavor working - a list of notes and things I learned as I got EndeavorOS operational

~~~yay -Ss <>~~~ allows me to search the AUR directory for packages to download and install. Ill have to look into
just what all the different prompts really are asking, but selecting none for all of them is the best option.
Importantly, when using yay, I'm putting a lot of trust in the community. I should only do this for packages I fully trust.
Otherwise, I should manually git the packages, build, inspect and then install them with pacman.
